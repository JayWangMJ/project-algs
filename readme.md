# CSC4120 Design and Analysis of Algorithms Code Warehouse

CSC4120 Design and Analysis of Algorithms is an undergraduate course by Prof. Costas, who is a presidential chair professor from School of Data Science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. 

The course covers following topics. Basics of algorithm analysis: correctness and time complexity, solving recurrences. Techniques for designing efficient algorithms: divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming. Fundamental search and graph algorithms: binary trees, hashing, graph traversals, shortest paths. Introduction to complexity theory: polynomial-time reductions and NP-completeness.

This warehouse stores Python codes for the algorithms introduced in the lectures. 

## Week 1
Complexity, sorting, peak finding.

For complexity comparison and sorting algorithms, please refer to programming assignment 1.


## Week 2
More examples of Divide and Conquer algorithms:

Find convex hull of given points, find rank i element in an array using median of medians, quick sort with different pivot selection rules, check if matrices AB=C, fast Fourier transform. 


## Week 3
Linear time sorting: counting sort, and radix sort; discussion of data structures, motivated by the runway reservation system: min-heap (with heap sort), for other data structures, please see your programming assignment 2.
