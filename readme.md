# CSC4120 Design and Analysis of Algorithms Code Warehouse

CSC4120 Design and Analysis of Algorithms is an undergraduate course by Prof. Costas, who is a presidential chair professor from School of Data Science, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. The course covers following topics. Basics of algorithm analysis: correctness and time complexity, solving recurrences. Techniques for designing efficient algorithms: divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming. Fundamental search and graph algorithms: binary trees, hashing, graph traversals, shortest paths. Introduction to complexity theory: polynomial-time reductions and NP-completeness.

This warehouse stores Python codes for the algorithms introduced in the lectures. 

## Week 1
Complexity, sorting, peak finding.

For complexity comparison and sorting algorithms, please refer to programming assignment 1.
